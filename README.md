# Airlines-Data-Analysis
Airlines Analysis using Python and SQL to derive valuable insights into flight performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency

# Key features:
* Data Extraction and Cleaning: Using SQL to query and clean the dataset to prepare it for analysis.
* Data Analysis and Visualization: Leveraging Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore trends, patterns, and correlations in the data.
* Performance Insights: Analyzing key metrics such as flight delays, cancellations, on-time performance, and route efficiency.
* Advanced Queries: Implementing complex SQL queries to extract insights from large datasets and perform aggregations, joins, and subqueries.

The project is structured to provide clear, step-by-step insights into airline operations, which can help inform decision-making in areas like scheduling, staffing, and customer service.
