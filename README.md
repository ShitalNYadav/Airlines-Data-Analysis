## Business Problem
Our company operates a diverse fleet of aircraft ranging from small business jets to medium-sized machines. We have been providing high-quality air transportation services to our clients for several years, and our primary focus is to ensure a safe, comfortable, and convenient journey for our passengers. However, we are currently facing challenges due to several factors such as stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased interest rates, rising fuel prices, and a tight labor market resulting in increased labor costs. As a result, the company's profitability is under pressure, and they are seeking ways to address this issue. To tackle this challenge, they are looking to conduct an analysis of their database to find ways to increase their occupancy rate, which can help boost the average profit earned per seat.

## Main Challenges
1. Stricter environmental regulations: The demand on the airlines industry to reduce its carbon footprint is growing, resulting in more stringent environmental laws that increase operating costs and restrict expansion potential.
2. Higher flight taxes: To address environmental issues and generate revenue, governments worldwide are imposing heavier taxes on aircraft, raising the cost of flying and decreasing demand.
3. Tight labor market resulting in increased labor costs: The shortage of trained personnel in aviation has driven up labor costs and increased turnover rates.

## Objectives
1. Increase Occupancy Rates: By raising occupancy rates, we can enhance the average profit per seat and alleviate the impact of the challenges we're facing.
2. Improve Price Strategy: We need to formulate a pricing strategy that considers the evolving market conditions and customer preferences, aiming to attract and retain customers.
3. Enhance Customer Experience: Our focus should be on delivering a seamless and convenient experience for our customers, spanning from booking to arrival. This approach will differentiate us in a highly competitive industry and foster customer loyalty.

The end goal of this task would be to identify opportunities to increase the occupancy rate on low-performing flights, which can ultimately lead to increased profitability for the airline.


# Key features:
* Data Extraction and Cleaning: Using SQL to query and clean the dataset to prepare it for analysis.
* Data Analysis and Visualization: Leveraging Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore trends, patterns, and correlations in the data.
* Performance Insights: Analyzing key metrics such as flight delays, cancellations, on-time performance, and route efficiency.
* Advanced Queries: Implementing complex SQL queries to extract insights from large datasets and perform aggregations, joins, and subqueries.

The project is structured to provide clear, step-by-step insights into airline operations, which can help inform decision-making in areas like scheduling, staffing, and customer service.

## Conclusion 
In summary, analyzing revenue data such as total revenue per year, average revenue per ticket, and average occupancy per aircraft is crucial for airlines aiming to maximize profitability. By assessing these indicators, airlines can identify areas for improvement and adapt their pricing and route plans accordingly. A higher occupancy rate stands as a crucial factor in enhancing profitability since it enables airlines to optimize revenue while minimizing costs related to empty seats. Additionally, airlines should consider revising the pricing strategy for each aircraft. The disparity between lower and higher prices may deter people from purchasing tickets for those specific aircraft. Establishing a reasonable price aligned with the aircraft's condition and facilities is essential, avoiding extremes of overly cheap or expensive prices.

Moreover, increasing occupancy rates should not compromise consumer satisfaction or safety standards. Airlines must strike a balance between the imperative for profit and the importance of delivering high-quality service while upholding stringent safety regulations. By adopting a data-driven approach to revenue analysis and optimization, airlines can potentially achieve long-term success in a highly competitive industry.
